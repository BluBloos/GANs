# GANs!

This repo serves as an archive of the work I did as a general design team member under **<a style="text-align:left" href="https://qmind.ca/#Research">
DAIR @ QMIND
</a>** from 2020-2021.

While our project was unable to produce compelling results, I was able to take away from the experience a working knowledge of Tensorflow, PyTorch, GANs, and CNNs. 

I also developed the ability to read and understand state-of-the-art papers in ML. 
Here is a highlight of some of the papers I read and enjoyed:
- Generative Adversarial Networks: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf
- Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/srivastava14a.pdf
- Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf

Pictured below is a gif capturing the output of a custom GAN as it trains to generate the MNIST data set.
